# Evolutionary algorithm
I wrote this program in Java as a project for my Java and Artificial Intelligence classes. The program tries to find a minimum of nodes needed to cover all the edges on a given map.

## Disclaimer
The program is not properly tested nor is a best example of my coding skills. It needed to be written quickly and according to certain boudaries given by the class' guidelines.

## How to run the program
To run the program, run "PJV-Evolution.jar" file in the "build" folder.
Folder "build/maps" contains all the maps the evolution can run on.

## Documentation
The documentation can be found in "build/javadoc".

## Source code
The source code is located in the "code" folder.

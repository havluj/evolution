# Evolutionary algorithm
I wrote this program in Java as a project for my [Java](https://edux.fit.cvut.cz/courses/BI-PJV/en/start) and Artificial Intelligence](https://edux.fit.cvut.cz/courses/BI-ZUM/en/start) classes. The program tries to solve the [Minimal vertex coverage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertex_cover) problem on a given map using the evolutionary programming techniques.

## Disclaimer
The program is not properly tested nor is a best example of my coding skills. It needed to be written rapidly due to the conditions of the classes at school. Please, be aware that I had to respect certain guidelines and boundaries because this was a school project.

## How to run the program
To run the program, run "PJV-Evolution.jar" file in the "build" folder.
Folder "build/maps" contains all the maps the evolution can run on.

## Documentation
The documentation can be found in the "build/javadoc" folder.

## Source code
The source code is located in the "code" folder.
